[moffitt.julie@gmail.com](moffitt.julie@gmail.com)

The following portfolio includes a compilation of writing samples, research publications and data science projects I've conducted that I feel best represent my interests and skills.  Most recently I've blended several of these areas in development of a deep learning model for the detection of malaria from color images of red blood cells and a research project examining gender differences in pacing skill during ultramarathon distance running performances. I am finding that my analytical experiences in bench science are advantageous in designing a rigorous approach to formulating and testing data science hypotheses and interpreting the outcomes within the context of appropriate statistical methods.  Writing and communicating these analytical insights in a clear, concise manner is a challenge I enjoy. I have provided several examples of this competency in several forms below.  I enjoy working at the intersection of these multi-faceted areas to improve the health and well-being of individuals across all spectrums of society.  Always immediately mindful of the biases and challenges inherent in developing ethical models and analytical tools, I work to ensure these factors are considered and minimized as much as possible.  In addition, ensuring that these insights are communicated in an accessible form is very important to me as a scientist and writer.  A link to my full-length CV and more current research efforts are provided below. Feel free to explore these links for examples of my work in all these areas. 

## Writing Samples

### [Editorial Focus:role for neural growth factor in autonomically driven arrhythmogenesis? Focus on: “Structural neuroplasticity following T5 spinalcord transection: increased cardiac sympathetic innervation density and SPNarborization”](https://github.com/jamoffitt67/jamoffitt67.github.io/blob/5d7438652e2e08a79966cc3d0b90420c5b503372/ajpregu.00524.2010.pdf) <i style="font-size:0.8em">Editorial Focus Writing Sample</i> 
I was asked to review a manuscript, and during subesequent publication, the editor asked me to write an editorial focus to accompay the publication.  The link to this short editorial focus provides a good example of my scientific writing style. I was delighted to have the opportunity to introduce the paper and provide some context for the data to the scientific community.

### [Capillary Circulation:  A reading guide for first-year medical and physician assistant students](https://github.com/jamoffitt67/jamoffitt67.github.io/blob/5d7438652e2e08a79966cc3d0b90420c5b503372/Capillary%20Circulation%20Handout.pdf) <i style="font-size:0.8em">Educational Content Writing Sample</i> 
I have routinely provided reading guides to accompay my lectures and teaching modules in physiology.  This reading guide is an example of my writing style to an audience consisting of students in the graduate health profesions.  Many students have commented through the years of how helpful these concise guides have been to help them refresh content as they prepare for boards or clinical rotations in sub-specialty areas.

### [All in the timing: An excerpt from: "The Runner's World Big Book of Marathon and Half-Marathon Training: Winning Strategies, Inpiring Stories, and the Ultimate Training Tools"](https://github.com/jamoffitt67/jamoffitt67.github.io/blob/5d7438652e2e08a79966cc3d0b90420c5b503372/LaySample.png) <i style="font-size:0.8em">Educational Content Writing Sample</i> 
I worked with the editors of Runner's World in creating a description of the interplay between circadian rhythms and stress for runners.  This provides an example of how I customize written communication on physiologic and scientific information for a lay audience.

Using `statsmodels`, I develop a robust **multivariate linear
regression model** to predict property values in Boston based on a
host of variables, including water quality, pupil-to-teacher ratio,
proximity to the Charles River, and others. This project revealed inherent bias in many housing classification and valuation models. Contextual use of these data must be given careful consideration.
