The following portfolio includes a compilation of research projects
I've conducted and published as a physiologist including several recent
data science projects. I am currently blending
these two areas of experience and interest in development of a deep learning model for the detection of malaria from color images of red blood cells and a research project examining gender differences in pacing ultramarathon distance running. I am finding that my analytical experiences in bench science are advantageous in designing a rigorous approach to formulating and testing data science hypotheses and interpreting the outcomes within the context of appropriate statistical methods.  Additionally, it is exciting to employ and leverage these new, powerful analytical tools in answering some of the big questions facing society today.  I enjoy working at the intersection of these two areas to improve the health and well-being of individuals across all spectrums of society.  I am always immediately mindful of the biases and challenges inherent in developing ethical models and analytical tools and working to ensure these factors are considered and minimized as much as possible.  A link to my full-length CV and more current research efforts are provided below. Feel free to explore links for examples of my work in all these areas. 

## Data Science Projects 

### [Deep Learning Model for Detection of Malaria from RBC Images.  Part I: EDA](https://github.com/jamoffitt67/jamoffitt67.github.io/blob/a021c5adb71bfac327e102c103356a7a6bcd2559/Optimization%20of%20a%20CNN%20model%20for%20detection%20of%20malaria%20in%20erythrocytes.%20%20Part%20I_Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20(1).ipynb) Using `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` and `Keras` I perform EDA on 20,929 color images of erythrocytes used for subsequent model development in the automatic detection of malaria.  

### [Deep Learning Model for Detection of Malaria from RBC Images.  Part II: CNN Model Development](https://github.com/jamoffitt67/jamoffitt67.github.io/blob/b5fdde444e4cc1db08e63ee14804f013f6fd2071/Part%20II_Optimization%20of%20CNN%20model%20for%20automatic%20detection%20of%20malaria.ipynbSubsequently) Using `TensorFlow` and `Keras` I explore 7 different deep learning approaches to develop a convoluted neural network (CNN) model that uses color images of red blood cells to detect malaria with 99% accuracy, 99% precision and 99% recall. `Tensorboard` was used to visualize and compare model performance.

### [Amazon Stock Forecasting](https://github.com/jamoffitt67/jamoffitt67.github.io/blob/ad1f0adbf8dcf670e4a7a550b551cbde5f0ed41d/Amazon_Stock_Project_Time_Series_PF.ipynb) <i style="font-size:0.8em">Time Series Analysis</i>
Using `sklearn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, and `statsmodels`, I train
an **ARIMA predictive model** to accurately forecast Amazon stock
prices over a period of two years.

### [Street View Housing Number Image Recognition](https://github.com/jamoffitt67/jamoffitt67.github.io/blob/f3524873b9821502743b54be20b181b5c8dfd339/CNN_Project_SVHN_PF.ipynb) <i style="font-size:0.8em">Deep Learning</i>
Deep Learning is powerful analytical tool for automating
traditionally human tasks. In this project, I use `TensorFlow` to
create and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to
recognize digits in images.

### [Amazon Product Recommendation](https://github.com/jamoffitt67/jamoffitt67.github.io/blob/237f3589eb018c249bc148b62274d389c595a264/Amazon_Recommendation_System_PF.ipynb) <i style="font-size:0.8em">Recommendation Systems</i>
Using the `surprise` statistics library, I implement **k-nearest
neighbors (KNN)** and **collaborative-filtering** recommendation
schemes designed to predict users' preferences based on user and
item data.

### [Target Customer Classification](https://github.com/jamoffitt67/jamoffitt67.github.io/blob/0f563df8428e368fee922da06b9c75684142f635/Classification_Decision_Tree_Random_Forests_PF.ipynb) <i style="font-size:0.8em">Decision Trees and Random Forests</i>
In this project, I use `sklearn` to build **decision tree and random
forest classification systems** to identify professionals looking to
upskill or reskill.

### [Boston Housing Prediction](https://github.com/jamoffitt67/jamoffitt67.github.io/blob/3b4945b507e96735f04cc0ea0c967ea7c3fca7c1/Boston_house_price_prediction_pf%20(1).ipynb) <i style="font-size:0.8em">Linear Regression</i>
Using `statsmodels`, I develop a robust **multivariate linear
regression model** to predict property values in Boston based on a
host of variables, including water quality, pupil-to-teacher ratio,
proximity to the Charles River, and others. This project revealed inherent bias in many housing classification and valuation models. Contextual use of these data must be given careful consideration.

### [Hotel Cancelation Prediction](https://github.com/jamoffitt67/jamoffitt67.github.io/blob/911d9bfa8e69cacd34581273895c59a583cee566/Project_Classification_Hotel_Cancelation_PF%20(1).ipynb) <i style="font-size:0.8em">Classification Methods</i>
With `sklearn`, I use a **k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification
algorithm** to identify potential hotel reservation cancellations
ahead of time.

### [Fuel Economy of Early Model Automobiles](https://github.com/jamoffitt67/jamoffitt67.github.io/blob/668415aa6991a606b6be1dfb3ca4f5193e4477ba/PCA_tSNE_MPG_explore_PF.ipynb) <i style="font-size:0.8em">Similarity Measures</i>
Using **t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)** and
**k-nearest neighbor (KNN)** algorithms, I investigate the
relationships between fuel economy, engine displacement, horsepower,
and other variables of interest in early model automobiles.
